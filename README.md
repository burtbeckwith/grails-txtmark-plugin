Another Grails plugin to provide support for rendering markdown, using the [Txtmark][] markdown processor. 

See [Daring Fireball][] for markdown syntax.

### Why another Markdown plugin

There are a couple of Grails plugins that already allow markdown to be rendered as HTML. My reasons for creating
yet another one are as follows: 
 
 * The [Grails Markdown Plugin][] uses [pegdown][] and a [parboiled][] parser. Later versions of parboiled
  use a version of [ASM] which is not compatible with Grails 2.x.
 * The [Grails Markdown Decorator Plugin][] uses [markdownj]. However, the decorator plugin trims strings before
  processing which may cause rendering side-effects (for example, strings that start with a bullet list `" * bullet"`
   will be outdented).
